This repository contains an automation script for to remove the Palo Alto Networks Cortex XDR Agent. The script is designed to automate the process of uninstalling the Cortex XDR agent from endpoints where the agent cannot be upgraded or uninstalled through the usual methods due to installation issues. These scripts provide a solution for IT administrators and cybersecurity professionals to efficiently address common issues with Cortex XDR agent installations.

## :page_with_curl: About the Script

This repository includes a PowerShell script tailored for Windows environments. The script automates the process of attempting to uninstall the Cortex XDR agent using the standard uninstaller and, if needed, falling back to the Cortex XDR Agent Cleaner tool. The script also schedules a task to run the XDR Agent Cleaner tool after a system reboot, and deletes the scheduled task afterwards.

### Features

- **Automated Tamper Protection Disablement**: Automatically handles the disabling of tamper protection using the Cortex utility tool.
- **Fallback to Cortex Cleaner Tool**: If the standard uninstallation fails, the script automatically invokes the Cortex Cleaner Tool with appropriate parameters.
- **Scheduled Task for Reboot**: Automatically schedules the cleaner tool to run after a reboot if the initial uninstall attempt fails.
- **Logging**: Detailed logging of all operations to help diagnose and troubleshoot.
